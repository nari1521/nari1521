👀	Cloud Infrastructure Set up in Aws
🤷‍♂️Project Title: AWS VPC Deployment with Public & Private Subnets in Production Environment
Description: Designed and implemented a robust AWS infrastructure utilizing a range of services to support a scalable and secure production environment.

😎Key Responsibilities and Achievements:
•	VPC Configuration: Created a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with appropriate CIDR block allocation to ensure isolated networking for resources.
•	Subnet Design: Configured public and private subnets across multiple availability zones (AZs) to facilitate separation of resources and enhance fault tolerance.
•	Route Table Management: Implemented custom route tables to efficiently route traffic between subnets and external networks using route propagation techniques.
•	Internet Gateway Setup: Established an Internet Gateway (IGW) to enable direct connectivity for resources in public subnets to the internet while maintaining security.
•	NAT Gateway Implementation: Deployed NAT Gateways in public subnets to facilitate secure outbound internet access for instances in private subnets.
•	Load Balancer Configuration: Configured Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) to distribute incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance.
•	Auto Scaling Deployment: Implemented Auto Scaling groups to dynamically adjust EC2 capacity based on traffic demand, optimizing resource utilization and application performance.
•	EC2 Instance Management: Provisioned and managed EC2 instances across different instance types and sizes to support application requirements and workload demands.
🤖Tools and Technologies Used:
•	AWS VPC, Subnets, Route Tables, Internet Gateway, NAT Gateway, Load Balancer (ELB), Auto Scaling, EC2 instances
✔Outcome: Successfully deployed and maintained a scalable, high-performance infrastructure that met stringent performance, availability, and security requirements for a production environment
